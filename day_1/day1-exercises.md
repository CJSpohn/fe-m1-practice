On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
* The purpose of html code is to provide structure to a website's elements to be interpreted by the browser and read by the user.

What is the difference between an element and a tag?
* A tag is the opening and closing brackets that determine the type of element being used.

Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
* We use attributes to assign values to elements and to id them to be accessed and used by other pieces of code.

Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
* Much like in a standard written document these break up a webpage into readable title and body components for the browser.

In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
* Right click > inspect source

List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
1. `<h1> - <h6>` represent different headings.
2. `<b>` for bold text
3. `<i>` for italic text
4. `<br>` for a line break
5. `<blockquote>` to insert a long form quotation
6. `<sup>` or `<sub>` for superscript and subscript

What are empty elements?
* Empty elements are those that do not require closing brackets. They contain their information within the element.

What is semantic markup?
* Semantic markup is that which describes its meaning to the browser and the developer.

What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
1. `<header>` and `<footer>`
2. `<nav>`
