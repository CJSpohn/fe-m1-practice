      <div class="pText">
        <p>I have been climbing for about 7 years. I worked as a commercial routesetter in <a class="inlineLink" href="https://www.thespotgym.com/" target="_blank">one of the most
            well known bouldering gyms in the world</a> for 2 years. I love any chance to get on the wall,
          rock or plywood, day or night.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h4>Front Desk</h4>
      <h5>The Spot Bouldering Gym (Boulder)</h5>
      <p>The first year of my climbing gym career was spent behind the desk greeting customers and representing
        the business as the one of the many faces of The Spot. I began to learn the ins and outs of the industry and
        decided that it was a place I desperately wanted to be.</p>
      <h4>Routesetter</h4>
      <h5>The Spot Bouldering Gym (Boulder)</h5>
      <p>After my year at the desk I found my way into the routesetting department and began setting regularly as a
        full-time setter. This included weekly resets as well as annual competitions and events. </p>
      <h4>Assisstant Head Routesetter</h4>
      <h5>The Spot Bouldering Gym (Boulder, Denver)</h5>
      <p>After a year or so we opened a second location and with that came a promotion to assisstant head routesetter
        where I was responsible for overseeing and performing the maintenance for both gyms as well as assissting
        in the day to day when my boss was out of town.</p>
